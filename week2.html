    <h1>Week 2 practise</h1>
    <h2> attempting what we have learnt since we began the coding classes</h2>

    <p>As you all know, practising daily, we create a routine, and eventually a habit will be created <b>The end goal is
            to have understood and mastered all the coding processes and procedures.</b> Having mastered that, i will
        slowly start doing my projects as i market myself, doing my own projects will make me be more farmiliar with
        website building procudures and also complete the task in an easy way </p>
